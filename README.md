### Aplikacja Silent Notifier 

Our idea was to create service which allows deaf people to communicate with people who don't know sign language.

The service allows on:
- converting speech to movie in Polish Sign Language
- converting text to movie in Polish Sign Language
- receiving push notifications from backend which may in future be connected to airport and railway stations announcment systems.

Language before conversion is simplified.

In this repository available is functional prototype.
